# Vue.js-Meetup
A repository to show an application programmed in order to showcase the typescript support of vue.js in a vue.js meetup

## Installation
The watchlist application is in the package `/watchlist-done`.
There you have to install the needed dependencies with `npm`.

```
$ cd watchlist-done
$ npm install
```

For best experience you should use the ui of the new vue-cli 3.
You can find the cli here:
``https://cli.vuejs.org/``

Alternatively you can just run the application with

```
$ npm serve
```

##Have Fun!
